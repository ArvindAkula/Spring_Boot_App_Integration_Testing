# Spring_Boot_App_Integration_Testing
**Course Objectives**
In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:
Build a Java Junit test that tests the Rand class with various input parameters.
Add an Integration Sanity Test using the Spring Boot Testing Framework with Java.
Develop an Integration Test using MockMvc to allow serverless Integration Testing.
By the end , you will be able to use the Java Spring Boot Application Software Testing to create a test environment that tests a Spring Boot Rest Web Service.



**Project Structure**
The hands on project on Java Spring Boot Application Software Testing is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Create a basic Unit Test of the Rand Service Class Using Java and JUnit Testing Framework.
Task 2: Build a Java Junit test that tests the Rand class with various input parameters.
Task 3: Add an Integration Sanity Test using the Spring Boot Testing Framework with Java
Task 4: Create an Integration Test with Incorrect Request Parameters and check for empty response. 	
Task 5: Develop an Integration Test using MockMvc to allow serverless Integration Testing.
